Arduino codes for random motor and random blinking for products which can be ported to AVR and miniaturised for sale. Codes written by Harish Ravi from 2019 and always developing.. The recently uploaded sort random is best..

When there are 10 LEDs blinking randomly at selection and time of blink and color its very grand and rich. On off can be done by animals but random nos generation is advanced human.

LCD fun and teach might be most fun!


I made a mistake by not mailing to a few profs and friends other than team the AVR obstacle and trech avoider pet/rover code with 2 motors and 2 look front and 2 look down sensors with interrupts in 2007.
